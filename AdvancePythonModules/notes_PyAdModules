Collections -> built-in datatype in base python
			- implements specialized container datatypes
				- using python's specialized containers in a special, more effective way
					- when we say built-in python containers, it refers to dictionary,tuples etc datatypes
--------------------------------------

Shutil and OS -> allows to easily navigate to any file/s in the computer and to peform different actions on it

--------------------------------------

Datetime - > this modules helps to create objects which have information on various aspects such as date time etc as well as timezones and perform opartions

--------------------------------------

Math and Random -> Math module contain different function to help do the mathematical tasks and
				-> Random module hold different function to get any random number or to shuffle the python objects

--------------------------------------

Python debugger -> a built - in python tool to help understand the variables, mid-operation of the code
					- we can set trace at certain point where we think the error is and then start exploring the variable and there details
					- we get an interactive tool in which we can enter varibale and do operation to get the bottom of error
					- it is like setting a breakpoint in the code
					- best replacement for the original tool for debugging i.e. print statements :)

-------------------------------------

Regular Expressions(regex) -> regular expressions helps to find a general pattern in the given set of data
							- python library for regular expression is -> re
						   -> understanding the regex syntax is very important
						   -> example 1. find all the phone numbers in the given large file.
								1. Defind/understand general syntax of phone numbers for Ex -> (987)-398-9867
								2. start creating the regex patters -> r"(\d\d\d)-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d"
									a. r" ->  helps to let python know that this not just a string but a REGEX
									b. \d -> general identifiers , here it is looking for digits
									c. (,),- -> the are some strings chars that we, for sure, know that it would be there
								3. It can also be written in a complex and more compact way using quantifiers -> r"(\d{3})-\d{3}-\d{4}"

						   -> important character identifiers:
								\d = A digit
								\w = An alphanumeric
								\s = white space
								\D = Non-digit
								\W = Non-alphanumeric
								\S = Non-whitespaces

						   -> important quantifiers:
								+ = occurs one or more time
								{3} = occurs a specific 3 time
								{3,4} = occurs 3 or 4 times
								{3,} = occurs 3 or more times
								* = occurs zero or more times
								? = once or more
