Collections -> built-in datatype in base python
			- implements specialized container datatypes
				- using python's specialized containers in a special, more effective way
					- when we say built-in python containers, it refers to dictionary,tuples etc datatypes
--------------------------------------

Shutil and OS -> allows to easily navigate to any file/s in the computer and to peform different actions on it

--------------------------------------

Datetime - > this modules helps to create objects which have information on various aspects such as date time etc as well as timezones and perform opartions

--------------------------------------

Math and Random -> Math module contain different function to help do the mathematical tasks and
				-> Random module hold different function to get any random number or to shuffle the python objects

--------------------------------------

Python debugger -> a built - in python tool to help understand the variables, mid-operation of the code
					- we can set trace at certain point where we think the error is and then start exploring the variable and there details
					- we get an interactive tool in which we can enter varibale and do operation to get the bottom of error
					- it is like setting a breakpoint in the code
					- best replacement for the original tool for debugging i.e. print statements :)

-------------------------------------

Regular Expressions(regex) -> regular expressions helps to find a general pattern in the given set of data
							- python library for regular expression is -> re
						   -> understanding the regex syntax is very important
						   -> example 1. find all the phone numbers in the given large file.
								1. Defind/understand general syntax of phone numbers for Ex -> (987)-398-9867
								2. start creating the regex patters -> r"(\d\d\d)-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d"
									a. r" ->  helps to let python know that this not just a string but a REGEX
									b. \d -> general identifiers , here it is looking for digits
									c. (,),- -> the are some strings chars that we, for sure, know that it would be there
								3. It can also be written in a complex and more compact way using quantifiers -> r"(\d{3})-\d{3}-\d{4}"

						   -> important character identifiers:
								\d = A digit
								\w = An alphanumeric
								\s = white space
								\D = Non-digit
								\W = Non-alphanumeric
								\S = Non-whitespaces

						   -> important quantifiers:
								+ = occurs one or more time
								{3} = occurs a specific 3 time
								{3,4} = occurs 3 or 4 times
								{3,} = occurs 3 or more times
								* = occurs zero or more times
								? = once or more


-------------------------------------

Timing the code -> by timing code we can identify the code's performance, which will in turn help us to identify the best and efficient solution

timeit -> for some code the elapsed time is so small that its impossible to compare
			so this module helps to decide which code is efficient by running the code over and over again to get comparable results
			-> it has 3 parts
				1. statement -> statement you want to run repetatively
				2. setup ->  code base for the statement
				3. number -> number of times we want to run the code
			-> for jupyter notebook -> a special syntax -> %%timeit
															and on next line the statement, it doesn't require setup as it find it from the cells above
														-> by default it runs 100000 times
