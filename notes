why python
	created by Guido van Rossum in 1990,
	python 3 release in 2008
	
	easy to use language
	high focus on readability (all about indentation and not complex braces)
		reduces developers time 
	lots of libraries and framework

command line
	windows - 
		called 'command prompt'
		1)curr directory - 		cd
		2)contents of directories - 	dir
		3)change directories - 		cd/{dir name/path}
		4)go back a directory - 	cd ..
		5)clear screen - 		cls
	linux/mac os -
		it is called 'Terminal' in both systems
		1)curr directory - 		pwd
		2)contents of directories - 	ls
		3)change directories - 		cd/{dir name/path}
		4)go back a directory - 	cd ..	
		5)clear screen - 		clear
		
--------------------
numbers
	power operations = 2 ** 3
		

python has 'Dynamic Typing' i.e. -> we can same variable with different datatypes in the code
	x = 2 
	x = "name"
type() - to get datatype
--------------------
strings - single quote or double quotes.
	ordered sequence.
	indexing is used to find the position of a single character
		indexing - starts at 0 and then 1,2,3,4...
		reverse indexing - starts at 0 and then ....-4,-3,-2,-1
			if string length is unknown and if the last characters is needed then we can say string[-1] .
	slicing - grab substring - syntax -> [start:stop:step]
			default step size  = 1
	string formatting 
		print .formating - print('your string {}'.format('workds/chars to be inserted'))
		float formatting  - (value:width.precision f)

	string immutability
		string chars cannot be reassigned, Ex. -> name = 'Advait', name[2] = 'w' is not supported by string.
----------------------
Lists-	ordered seq that hold different object types
		can be nested
		stored in [] and ',' to separate the objects
		indexing/reverse indexing and slicing can be done same as strings.
		we can concatinate lists together	
		"vIMP - > Lists are Mutable unlike strings"	
		append and pop
		sort -  happens in the string , nothing is returned
		reverse -  reversing the string

---------------------
'None' object - special python object, indicating no value. 
				default return value of function if nothing to return
--------------------

Dictionary - {'key': 'value',...} pair, no idex location, retrived based on key
			 key should be string
			 cannot be sorted, unordered.
			 use when we only want to retrive the object absed on key and not index
			 dictionary can hold lot of different data types (int, float, string, list etc.)
			 "vIMP - > Dictionaries are Mutable unlike strings"	
-------------------

Tuple - are like lists but two differences
		'Immutable'
		'() instead of  []'	
		- main use - for data integraty -> when we want to pass the object in code and we don't them to change accidentaly
