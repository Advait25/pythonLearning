why python
	created by Guido van Rossum in 1990,
	python 3 release in 2008
	
	easy to use language
	high focus on readability (all about indentation and not complex braces)
		reduces developers time 
	lots of libraries and framework

command line
	windows - 
		called 'command prompt'
		1)curr directory - 		cd
		2)contents of directories - 	dir
		3)change directories - 		cd/{dir name/path}
		4)go back a directory - 	cd ..
		5)clear screen - 		cls
	linux/mac os -
		it is called 'Terminal' in both systems
		1)curr directory - 		pwd
		2)contents of directories - 	ls
		3)change directories - 		cd/{dir name/path}
		4)go back a directory - 	cd ..	
		5)clear screen - 		clear
		
--------------------
numbers
	power operations = 2 ** 3
		

python has 'Dynamic Typing' i.e. -> we can same variable with different datatypes in the code
	x = 2 
	x = "name"
type() - to get datatype
--------------------
strings - single quote or double quotes.
	ordered sequence.
	indexing is used to find the position of a single character
		indexing - starts at 0 and then 1,2,3,4...
		reverse indexing - starts at 0 and then ....-4,-3,-2,-1
			if string length is unknown and if the last characters is needed then we can say string[-1] .
	slicing - grab substring - syntax -> [start:stop:step]
			default step size  = 1
	string formatting 
		print .formating - print('your string {}'.format('workds/chars to be inserted'))
		float formatting  - (value:width.precision f)

	string immutability
		string chars cannot be reassigned, Ex. -> name = 'Advait', name[2] = 'w' is not supported by string.
----------------------
Lists-	ordered seq that hold different object types
		can be nested
		stored in [] and ',' to separate the objects
		indexing/reverse indexing and slicing can be done same as strings.
		we can concatinate lists together	
		"vIMP - > Lists are Mutable unlike strings"	
		append and pop
		sort -  happens in the string , nothing is returned
		reverse -  reversing the string

---------------------
'None' object - special python object, indicating no value. 
				default return value of function if nothing to return
