I Highly recommend to do this course for interested people

It is an excellent course for beginner where we get to know python from basics and go to advance level. The instructor has structured the course in a very good way, module by module, that it makes it very easy to understandEach module has an exercise, I highly recommend to do it. 

Tools used
I have used Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook
But any IDE with python extension should be fine
