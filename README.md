Highly recommend to do this course for interested people
It is an excellent course for beginner where we get to know python from basics and got advance. The instructor has structured the course in a very good way, module by module, that it majes it very easy to understand
Each module has an exercise, I highly recommend to do it. 

I have used Visual Studio Code.
But any IDE with python extension should be fine
