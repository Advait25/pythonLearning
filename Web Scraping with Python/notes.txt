Web Scraping -> general term for technique involving automating the gathering of data from a website

Rules of Web Scraping -> 1)Always try to get permission or try to understand the law in a particular country
                        before performing scraping. Usually it is not a problem but it good to take care.
                         2)IF you make too many scraping attempts, your ip address could get blocked
                         3)Some site automatically block the scraping software


Limitation of Web Scraping -> 1)Each website requires a unique scraping script becasue the each website is unique.
                            2) so in case any website gets changed , the whole scraping script needs to be changed
